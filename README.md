LosslessCon
===========

I want to make it by using TideSDK which I think it will be *fun*^^. Also it will be much easier than using
win32 GUI programming to make a good looking GUI

I just want it to be simple and usefull. Only allow user to do losses converter which means there is no much
option to set convert parameters. 

how to build
---------------
* clone it on your computer
* download ffmpeg for windows from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
* unzip downloaded ffmpeg, rename it to ffmpeg and put it under LosslessCon/Resources/
* install TideSDK, WiX
* Follow instruction in TideSDK website to build this application

support platform
-----------------
* windows
* do not support ubuntu right now because in ubuntu commandline is very convenient.


Why I build this
-------------------
I want to convert .rmvb file to .mp4 file, so I can view it on my phone. 
Because I do not want to remeber the parameters to use FFMPEG, so I build this GUI
