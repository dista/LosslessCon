LosslessCon
===========

I want to make it by using TideSDK which I think it will be *fun*^^. Also it will be much easier than using
win32 GUI programming to make a good looking GUI

I just want it to be simple and usefull. Only allow user to do losses converter which means there is no much
option to set convert parameters. 

how to build
---------------
* clone it on your computer
* download ffmpeg for windows from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
* unzip downloaded ffmpeg, rename it to ffmpeg and put it under LosslessCon/Resources/
* install TideSDK, WiX
* Follow instruction in TideSDK website to build this application

support platform
-----------------
* windows
* do not support ubuntu right now because in ubuntu commandline is very convenient.


Why I build this
-------------------
I want to convert .rmvb file to .mp4 file, so I can view it on my phone. 
FFMPEG is powerful, but it is tedious to use, you need to type the commandline everytime and you may forget
 the commandline parameters. Use this GUI, you may feel better.
